# Chrome link shortener

---

This directory contains source code for a Chrome extension that shortens URLs in a browser.

To try it out, go to [chrome://extensions](chrme://extensions), enable developer mode, and load this directory as an unpacked extension.

You may also download it from the chrome store [here](https://jump.wtf/chrome-extension).

It should work fine in Firefox as well, if you use [Chrome Store Foxified](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/chrome-store-foxified/).
